- added tm_polygons, which is a combination of tm_fill and tm_borders
- fixed several small bugs

version 0.8
- added tm_raster
- improved legend behaviour: legend titles should be set in the layer functions (instead of in tm_layout)
- removed crop_shape, since raster::crop does the same job, but, but faster

- improved all examples for approx_areas, calc_densities
- fixed bug regarding drawing a frame with outer.margins=0. 
- fixed bug in plotting blubbles
