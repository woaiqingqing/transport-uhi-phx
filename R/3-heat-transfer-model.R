# for Phoenix City streets, the following are provided as minimum thicknesses for asphaltic concrete and base materials:
# Arterial: 152.4 mm (6in)
# Major Collector Street: 114.3 mm (4.5 in)
# Residential Collector Street: 76.2 mm (3 in)
# Local Street: 50.8 mm (2 in)

# Base materials may not be required for full depth asphaltic concrete design. 
# However, if base materials are required, then the minimum thickness will be: 152.4 mm (6in) for all base material types

# Design structural number (SN) can be converted to thickness of various flexible pavement layers by using structural layer coefficients.
