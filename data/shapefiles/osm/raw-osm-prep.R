## OSM DATA IMPORT and FORMART to BUFFER IN GIS ##

# this script is used to take the raw osm road network data
# and prep it for buffering the roadway links to approx
# the area of pavement from roads that exist in the metro area
# the buffering is done in QGIS because R is slow/ineffective
# at variable spatial buffering. the output of this QGIS
# variable buffer is provided instead of a scirpt in this case
# because the process is time consuming but this script is 
# included for transparency
