ibuttonID,NA,"ibutton ID assigned from the beginning of the study, the prefix may no longer match the original NDVI target (VH,H,M,L,VL)"
NDVI_originalbyUCR,value between -1 and 1,"The original NDVI values calculated by UC Riverside team…these values come from the 150m polygon that each ibutton falls within (the 150m polygons were calculated--I think-- by creating a fishnet over Phoenix and taking the mean NDVI within each polygon--from Landsat8 I believe...need to double check. The ibutton may be right on the edge of the polygon and really was just used as an original install target, so I'm not super-enthused about using this variable -- see the NDVIBuf30m_mean instead"
button_type,NA,Either air temperature only (AirT) or air temperature + relative humidity (RH)
